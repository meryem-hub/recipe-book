Spaghetti Carbonara Recipe
--------------------------

Ingredients:
- 200g (7 oz) spaghetti
- 100g (3.5 oz) pancetta or diced bacon
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 cloves garlic (optional)
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)

Instructions:

1. Cook the spaghetti in salted boiling water according to package instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.

2. In a bowl, whisk together eggs and grated Parmesan cheese. Set aside.

3. In a pan, cook pancetta (or bacon) over medium heat until crispy. Optionally add crushed garlic for extra flavor, then remove it after sautéing.

4. Remove the pan from heat. Add the hot drained spaghetti into the pan and toss with the bacon.

5. Quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, stirring vigorously so the eggs don't scramble. Add a bit of reserved pasta water to create a creamy sauce.

6. Season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper.

7. Serve immediately with extra Parmesan and chopped parsley on top.

Enjoy your creamy, cheesy, classic Italian carbonara! 🇮🇹🍝
